Variables, loops, conditionals, arrays


So the primitive data types are likely the same of the c++ along other similar data types which are ,derived(Array,Pointer,Referenve,Function);

There are also a data type which can be determined or declared by the user only . That means it is not prewritten or declared as it is for other data types like primitives are . (struct,class,enum,union)


There are some of them which only works in special ocaassion . Like I am about to create a program where user count would be started from the 0 . And it can not excced to negative . then we can use usigned int like ;

unsigned int =1000;
const = used in the constant variable where the variable's data stays constent.
long = To store the long integar numbers;

auto = No need to determine or set the variable type . The compiler would auto detect the data type .

Pointer = The pointer is used to address the address of another variable or simmilar types;
